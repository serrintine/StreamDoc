You will need to complete registration by filling in an extra form, which should be sent to your email. You will need to enter credit card info and receive a phone call for verification purposes, but you should not be charged any payment.

## Create an EC2 instance
Once your account is running you should be able to see a dashboard of all the services AWS provides. Scroll down to **Build a solution** and click on "Launch a virtual machine" to start the steps for creating a free EC2 instance.

Choose **Ubuntu** as the server OS. You will by default be alloted the free tier server configuration, which is a **t2.micro** instance with 1GB memory and 8GB storage.

## Setup RTMP server

First log into the server you've created. Linux servers are managed via SSH, which stands for secure shell. You get to issue text commands, and everything that happens between you and the server is encrypted.
